# Low-Level Design Series by Ishan

Welcome to the Low-Level Design (LLD) series by Ishan! 🚀 💻
This repository is a comprehensive collection of detailed low-level design problems, structured into different modules
covering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID design principles, design patterns (Creational, Structural,
Behavioral), and specific low-level design problems.

## OOP

The OOP module contains fundamental Java concepts, providing a solid foundation for understanding object-oriented
programming.

## SOLID Design Principles

Explore detailed explanations of the SOLID design principles, helping you write maintainable and scalable code.

## Design Patterns

Dive into the world of design patterns, categorized into three sub-modules:

### Creational

Discover design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the
situation.

### Structural

Explore patterns that focus on simplifying the composition of classes or objects, emphasizing the composition of classes
or objects.

### Behavioral

Learn patterns that concentrate on algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects, promoting
flexibility.

## Low-Level Design Problems

Each directory in this module corresponds to a specific low-level design problem. Inside each directory, you'll find a
comprehensive solution along with explanations, diagrams, and code samples.

Additionally, if you have a specific design problem you'd like me to cover or if you simply want to share your thoughts,
