// the need for calling the copy constructor from clone method is because there is no way we can access the properties of student in intelligent student
// the attributes are private and the getter methods are also not provided
// so the best way is to make use of copy constructor and from that make a call to the constructor of super class first
// Also, the need for clone method is because we want to achieve the dynamic binding (run-time polymorphism). If we would only make use of copy constructor to achieve
// the entire functionality, then we will have to depend on concrete classes only.
// Overriding the clone is not going to do the work
// How to create a copy of a child class
